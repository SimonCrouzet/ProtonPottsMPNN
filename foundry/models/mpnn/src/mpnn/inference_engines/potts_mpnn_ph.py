"""PottsMPNN-pH redesign engine (foundry wrapper).

Mirrors the ``MPNNWithLogProbs`` pattern: subclass the foundry PottsMPNN inference engine
(``mpnn.inference_engines.potts_mpnn.MPNNInferenceEngine``) so we reuse its checkpoint
loading, ``extended_vocab`` handling, transform-pipeline featurisation and device logic, and
add the protonation-aware redesign methods from the two research scripts
(``scripts/05_pmhc_binder_redesign_{potts,mpnn}.py`` in the conditional_binding/ph repo).

What this adds on top of the engine:
- ``PHDesignCriteria`` — config schema for a single design run (backend, method + knobs).
- design methods: ``autoregressive`` (masked decoder infill — the MPNN method),
  ``converged_mcmc``, ``two_phase`` and ``converged_mcmc_combined`` (placement-based, protonation-aware),
  plus the whole-chain baselines ``gibbs`` (Potts) and ``mpnn_sample`` (decoder).
- ``PHDesignOutput`` / ``PHDesignSet`` — the requested design-output classes that carry each
  design's sequence and its energy scores (final Potts H, centre selectivity, binder
  protonation ΔH, placement probability …), sortable lowest-energy-first.
- ``run_ph_redesign`` — featurise + forward ONCE, then run one or more criteria (a sweep over
  e.g. ``combined_lambda``) against the shared Potts tables and return a ``PHDesignSet``.

Starting sequence for placement (``seed_source``): ``native`` starts from the input-PDB / RFD3
sequence; ``inverse`` starts from externally supplied seeds (the inverse stage's sequences —
ProteinMPNN or the model's own MPNN sampling) passed in via ``initial_sequences``, running the
placement scan + neighbourhood redesign once per seed. MPNN seeds are produced by the inverse
stage, not re-sampled here — this engine only optimizes.

Conventions (unify the Potts energy head and the decoder log-prob field):
- the *design field* and all scores are ENERGIES with **lower = better**; the decoder field is
  ``-log P``. Invalid tokens are ``+inf``; sampling is ``softmax(-energy / T)``.
- vocab is the model's build-time choice; we read it back off the model
  (``graph_featurization_module.TOKEN_ENCODING``) and decode microstates to their canonical
  parent via ``mpnn.metrics.sequence_recovery._build_canonical_map`` + ``DICT_THREE_TO_ONE``
  (the foundry's own 21-token ``_decode_sequences`` cannot render the 11 protonation tokens).

# Placement-based, protonation-aware methods (place a centre RES-P, redesign its neighbourhood):
#   autoregressive  — mask neighbours to UNK, decode one-by-one (the MPNN script's infill).
#   converged_mcmc  — random single-site mutations until the sequence settles.
#   two_phase       — freeze least-disruptive selective picks, then stability cleanup.
#   converged_mcmc_combined — converged MCMC on a LEGACY, unscaled (1+λ)·stability − λ·mean_dep blend.
#                     NOTE: this is NOT the canonical objective. block_descent (below) is the manuscript

#   block_descent   — deterministic block coordinate descent: exact argmin over V**block_size joint
#                     assignments of each neighbour + its closest partners (near-exact MAP).
