"""One binder designed against several target states (for example human and mouse).

Each target state is its own complex with its own Potts tables and its own energies. The
binder is shared: the same residues, with the same sequence being designed. The ensemble
objective evaluates every term in every state with the shared binder tokens written into
that state's sequence, then reduces over states by ``max`` (the worst state) or ``mean``.
Scaling, scalarisation and selection are those of :class:`~mpnn.ph.objective.Objective`.
